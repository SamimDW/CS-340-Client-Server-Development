## Project Reflection

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I focus on clear, modular, well-documented code to create maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. Breaking down functionality into smaller, reusable functions or modules helps significantly. For example, I built a CRUD Python module in Project One that provided clear functions for database operations. Each function had a specific purpose (create, read, update, delete), making it easy to understand and adapt. This modularity allowed me to quickly integrate these database operations into the dashboard widgets in Project Two. Such an approach reduces code redundancy, simplifies debugging, and facilitates future modifications or enhancements. The CRUD module can easily be adapted for other databases or extended with additional functionalities.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem, I start with a comprehensive analysis of the requirements to gain a clear and complete understanding of the goals. For Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard, I carefully reviewed the client’s needs, defined the data structure, and chose appropriate database operations. This structured method differed from earlier assignments in other courses because it required directly linking backend functionality (CRUD operations) to frontend visualization (dashboard widgets). My strategy included iterative testing, regularly verifying that each component worked before moving to the next. In future projects, I'd continue using iterative design, frequent testing, and user feedback to ensure that databases precisely meet client requirements.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists analyze problems, design efficient solutions, and build tools that facilitate easier and better decision-making. They write clean, efficient code and develop systems that reliably handle real-world data and processes. In projects like Grazioso Salvare’s dashboard, a computer scientist’s role is essential because it translates raw data into actionable insights. The database and dashboard system I developed helps Grazioso Salvare efficiently manage animal rescue data, quickly identify available rescue animals, and make informed decisions. This significantly enhances operational efficiency, allowing them to focus more effectively on their primary animal rescue and placement mission.
